# Voltage: The Unit of Electric Potential

**Voltage (V)**, also known as **electric potential difference**, is a measure of the **energy per unit charge** that is
available to move electric charges through a circuit. It is one of the fundamental concepts in electricity.

### **Definition**:

Voltage is defined as the **difference in electric potential** between two points in a circuit. It is the **force** that
pushes the electric charge (usually electrons) through a conductor.

\[
V = \frac{W}{Q}
\]

Where:

- **V** = Voltage (Volts)
- **W** = Work (energy in joules)
- **Q** = Charge (in coulombs)

### **What Does Voltage Do?**

- **Voltage** is the driving force that makes **electric charge** move in a circuit.
- It provides the necessary **electromotive force (EMF)** to push electrons through a conductor, overcoming the
  resistance of the material.
- Voltage is the difference in potential energy per unit charge between two points: the **higher the voltage**, the more
  energy is available to move the charge.

### **Units of Voltage**:

- The unit of voltage is the **volt (V)**.
- 1 volt is defined as the **potential difference** that will cause a **1 ampere** current to flow through a **1-ohm
  resistor**.
- **1 V = 1 J/C** (1 joule per coulomb of charge).

### **Voltage in a Circuit**:

- Voltage exists between **two points** in a circuit, typically between the **positive and negative terminals** of a
  power source (e.g., battery, power supply).
- A **battery** provides a constant voltage (e.g., 1.5 V for AA batteries).
- **Power plants** or **electrical grids** operate at **high voltages** (e.g., 110 kV, 220 kV) to efficiently transport
  electricity over long distances.

### **Types of Voltage**:

1. **DC Voltage (Direct Current)**:
    - Voltage that remains constant in polarity and magnitude over time.
    - Common in batteries, power supplies, and low-voltage devices.
2. **AC Voltage (Alternating Current)**:
    - Voltage that reverses direction periodically, typically in the form of a sine wave.
    - Used in household electrical systems and power grids (e.g., 120V or 240V AC).

### **Voltage Sources**:

- **Batteries**: Provide DC voltage for devices such as flashlights, mobile phones, and small electronics.
- **Generators**: Provide AC voltage, often used in power plants to generate electricity for distribution.
- **Solar Panels**: Generate DC voltage through the conversion of light energy into electrical energy.

### **Voltage Drop**:

- As current flows through a circuit, it encounters **resistance**, which causes a **voltage drop** across the
  components.
- Voltage drop is important to understand, especially in long wiring runs, to ensure that electrical devices receive
  sufficient voltage to operate.

### **Example of Voltage in Real Life**:

- **Household power**: In many countries, electrical outlets supply **110V or 220V AC**, which powers devices like
  refrigerators, televisions, and computers.
- **Battery-powered devices**: A **9V battery** provides a constant voltage to power small devices like smoke detectors
  and handheld radios.

### **Conclusion**:

- **Voltage** is essential in driving current through a circuit and is often described as the **electrical pressure**
  that pushes electric charges.
- It is measured in **volts (V)**, and a clear understanding of voltage is key to designing electrical circuits,
  troubleshooting issues, and safely handling electrical systems.
