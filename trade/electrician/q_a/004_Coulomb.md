# Coulomb: The Unit of Electric Charge

A **Coulomb (C)** is the **SI unit of electric charge**. It measures the quantity of **electric charge** that passes
through a conductor when a **constant current of one ampere** flows for **one second**.

### **Definition:**

\[
1 \, C = 1 \, A \times 1 \, s
\]

Where:

- **A** is the unit of **current (ampere)**, which is the flow of electric charge per unit time.
- **s** is the unit of **time (second)**.

### **Meaning of Coulomb**:

- **Coulomb** is a **measure of the amount of charge**.
- It is defined as the amount of electric charge transferred by a **current of one ampere** flowing for **one second**.

### **Example**:

If you have a **1-ampere** current running through a wire for **1 second**, the amount of charge that has passed through
the wire is **1 Coulomb**.

### **Relationship to Electrons**:

- **1 Coulomb** is equivalent to approximately **6.242 × 10^18** **elementary charges** (the charge of a single
  electron).
- The charge of an **electron** is **-1.602 × 10^-19 Coulombs**. So, **1 Coulomb** contains the charge of **6.242 ×
  10^18 electrons**.

### **Significance in Electricity**:

- The **Coulomb** helps quantify the flow of charge in a circuit.
- It is essential for understanding the behavior of **electric current** and for calculating **electrical energy** and *
  *power**.

### **Real-world Example**:

- In a typical **electronic circuit**, when current flows through components like resistors, capacitors, and wires, the
  flow of **charge (measured in Coulombs)** is the basis for their function.
- **Capacitors** store charge in the form of **Coulombs**, and the **voltage across a capacitor** is related to the
  amount of charge stored in it.

Thus, the Coulomb plays a critical role in the **quantification of electric charge** and is foundational in the study of
electricity and electronics.
