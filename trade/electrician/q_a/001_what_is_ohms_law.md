# Ohm's Law History

Ohm's Law is named after Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist and mathematician who formulated the law in 1827. Ohm
discovered that the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electrical circuit is linear, meaning
that current is directly proportional to the voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance.

Ohm's Law states that the current (I) flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the
voltage (V) across the two points and inversely proportional to the resistance (R) of the conductor:

V=I×R

Why is it called Ohm's Law?

Georg Simon Ohm was the first to clearly define and mathematically express this relationship in a consistent and
reliable way, which became a fundamental principle in electrical engineering.
Before Ohm's work, the behavior of electric currents was not fully understood, and Ohm's Law provided a practical and
simple explanation for how voltage, current, and resistance interact in an electrical circuit.
Ohm's discovery was pivotal in advancing the study of electricity, and his name has since been associated with this
foundational law.

# Ohm's Law

**Ohm's Law** is a fundamental principle in electrical engineering that defines the relationship between **voltage (V)
**, **current (I)**, and **resistance (R)** in an electrical circuit. It is expressed by the formula:

```V=I×R```

Where:

- **V** is the **voltage** (in volts, V) – the potential difference that pushes the current through the circuit.
- **I** is the **current** (in amperes, A) – the flow of electric charge through the circuit.
- **R** is the **resistance** (in ohms, Ω) – the opposition to the flow of current in the circuit.

## Key Points:

- **Voltage (V)**: The force that pushes the electric charge through the circuit. It can be compared to water pressure
  in a pipe.
- **Current (I)**: The flow of electric charge, which is the rate at which electrons move through the conductor (like
  water flowing in the pipe).
- **Resistance (R)**: The opposition that a material offers to the flow of current. It can be thought of as the friction
  that slows down the water flow in the pipe.

## Applications:

- If you know any two of the quantities (voltage, current, resistance), you can use **Ohm's Law** to calculate the
  third.
    - **To calculate Current (I)**:  
      ```I=V/R```

        - **To calculate Resistance (R)**:  
          ```R=V/I```

## Example:

If a circuit has a voltage of 12V and a resistance of 4Ω, the current would be:

```I= 12V/4Ω = 3A```

**Ohm’s Law** is essential for designing and analyzing electrical circuits and is the foundation for many electrical
calculations and troubleshooting.
