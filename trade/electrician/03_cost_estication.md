# Best Practices for Electrical Design & Cost Reduction:

1. **Safety First**:
    - Always follow the **National Electrical Code (NEC)** or the local electrical standards for safety and compliance.
    - **Grounding and Bonding**: Properly ground all systems to prevent electrical shocks and ensure safety.
    - **Circuit Overload Protection**: Use appropriately rated circuit breakers to avoid overloads and increase safety.

2. **Planning for Future Expansion**:
    - **Spare Capacity**: Design circuits with future expansion in mind. Leave room for additional outlets or circuits
      as the electrical needs of the property grow.
    - **Conduit Sizing**: Use slightly larger conduit than necessary to easily add more wiring in the future, saving on
      labor and material costs later.

3. **Efficient Lighting and Power Distribution**:
    - **LED Lighting**: Use **LED lights** for their long lifespan and lower energy consumption. This will save on
      long-term electricity bills and maintenance costs.
    - **Proper Lighting Placement**: Ensure adequate coverage for all areas with frequent use. This avoids over-lighting
      and unnecessary use of electricity.
    - **Power Outlets**: Install sufficient outlets to avoid the need for extension cords, which can lead to
      overloading. Consider **GFCI outlets** in wet areas like kitchens and bathrooms.

4. **Dedicated Circuits for High-Power Appliances**:
    - Ensure **dedicated circuits** for **water heaters**, **air conditioners**, **ovens**, and other high-power
      devices. This reduces the risk of overload and potential damage to shared circuits.

5. **Consideration of Smart Technologies**:
    - If you plan to integrate **smart home technologies**, make sure the system supports the necessary load. **Smart
      thermostats** or lighting may add a small but manageable load to the electrical system.
    - **Plan for scalability**: Install wiring and electrical systems that can accommodate smart technologies in the
      future.

6. **Maximize Safety**:
    - Install **smoke and carbon monoxide detectors** in high-risk areas (hallways, kitchens, near sleeping areas) to
      ensure safety.
    - **RCDs (Residual Current Devices)** provide essential protection from electrical shocks and should be install
